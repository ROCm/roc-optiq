ROCm Optiq documentation
************************

:doc:`ROCm™ Optiq <what-is-optiq>` provides deep insights into system-level performance for applications running on the ROCm stack. 

It serves as the GUI for visualizing traces collected by ROCm profiling tools, specifically `ROCm Systems Profiler <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler-systems/en/latest/index.html>`_, enabling developers to analyze traces, identify bottlenecks, optimize workloads, and efficiently scale applications across CPUs and GPUs. 

The component public repository is located at `https://github.com/ROCm/roc-optiq <https://github.com/ROCm/roc-optiq>`_.
